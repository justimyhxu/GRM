## Todo List
- [x] Release gradio demo code.
- [x] Release inference code.
- [x] Release pretrained models.
- [ ] Release training code.

## GRM Demo
* [Huggingface Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/GRM-demo/GRM)
* [Replicate Demo](https://replicate.com/camenduru/grm). Thanks [@camenduru](https://github.com/camenduru) for the [jupyter code](https://github.com/camenduru/GRM-jupyter)! 

## Requirements
* 64-bit Python 3.10 and PyTorch 2.0.1 or higher.
* CUDA 11.8 
* Users can use the following commands to install the packages
```bash
conda create -n grm python=3.10
conda activate grm 
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
cd third_party/diff-gaussian-rasterization &&  pip install -e .
```
## Pretrained weights
Pretrained weights can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/justimyhxu/GRM/tree/main).
```bash
# Example
mkdir checkpoints && cd checkpoints
wget https://huggingface.co/justimyhxu/GRM/resolve/main/grm_u.pth -O grm_u.pth && cd ..
```

Note that we provide three checkpoints for use. We use the OpenCV coordinate system.

| Checkpoint | Training settings |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| [grm_u.pth](https://huggingface.co/justimyhxu/GRM/blob/main/grm_u.pth)  | The elevations are all 20 degrees and the azimuths uniformly cover all the 360-degree information.|
| [grm_r.pth](https://huggingface.co/justimyhxu/GRM/blob/main/grm_r.pth)  | The azimuths roughly cover the 360-degree information. |
| [grm_zero123plus.pth](https://huggingface.co/justimyhxu/GRM/blob/main/grm_zero123plus.pth) | Three views are with 30-degree elevations and the azimuths are evenly distributed at intervals of 120 degrees. Another view has the elevation of -20 degrees and the azimuth is 60 degrees different from one of the three. |


Besides, you need to download checkpoints for [SV3D](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d/tree/main).
```bash
cd checkpoints
wget https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d/blob/main/sv3d_p.safetensors && cd ..
```


## Inference
```bash
# text-to-3D
python test.py --prompt 'a car made out of cheese'
# image-to-3D with zero123plus-v1.1
python test.py --image_path examples/dragon2.png --model zero123plus-v1.1
# image-to-3D with zero123plus-v1.2
python test.py --image_path examples/dragon2.png --model zero123plus-v1.2
# image-to-3D with SV3D
python test.py --image_path examples/dragon2.png --model sv3d
```

Add ```--fuse_mesh True``` if you would like to get the textured mesh.
Add ```--optimize_texture True``` if you would like to optimize texture on extracted textured mesh.

## Gradio Demo
We provide an offline gradio demo, which can be run with the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
